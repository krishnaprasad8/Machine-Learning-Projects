A learning algorithm that uses a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called Long Short-Term Memory is used in this project (LSTM). By changing hyperparameters, the network is trained and tested for accuracy, and the results are tabulated and visualized. By exploring the model space, two different models are trained. In this project, models are trained, and stock prices are projected using various hyperparameter modifications.
